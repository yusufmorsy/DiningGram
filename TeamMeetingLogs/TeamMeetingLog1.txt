Meeting Log 1: 10/28/2024

Both during and after meeting with our TA on Monday, we have made the following decisions:

Features: We discussed to implement the following key features: 
 (1) users can create posts, 
 (2) users can leave likes on posts, 
 (3) a comment system under each post, 
 (4) a rating system (such as assigning a given number of stars out of 5 based on all reviews posted for the dining hall in question), 
 (5) directing users to the link containing the dining hall location details, and 
 (6) log in and out of the page as well as creating accounts

Data Querying: Currently, we are focusing on using PostgreSQL, as it's the database management system that we're most experienced with.
Roles and Responsibilities: For project development, we are assigning
- Rodolfo Martinez-Maldonado and Yusuf Morsy for the back-end development of the project while
- Luke Chabin and Andy Wood will work on the front-end development.
