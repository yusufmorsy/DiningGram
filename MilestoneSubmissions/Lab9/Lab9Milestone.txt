Application Name: DiningGram

Application Description

Our application is a social media platform that revolves around the dining halls on campus. Users can upload pictures of their food 
and dining hall experiences. On their posts, they can include a rating for the dining experience, a dining hall location, and a 
caption. Users can view other posts and like, save, and leave comments on them, and they can click on the dining hall location to 
filter posts by that specific dining hall. The user can also edit their profile, adding a profile picture and bio, and view other 
user’s profiles, where they can see that user’s posts and saved posts.

Through our media platform, students will be actively engaged in creating a community-driven resource to improve their overall dining 
experience by highlighting the most and least favorable aspects of each dining hall. With this tool, students will have the opportunity 
to share constructive feedback, make informed dining decisions, and contribute to a positive impact on campus.

Vision Statement

For CU Boulder students, who want to connect with other students about the common dining halls we all eat at. Dining Gram is a 
website that easily connects students in a way that feels familiar and enjoyable. Unlike Nutrislice, our product gives students 
an authentic view of how the food tastes, and the best options available according to students.

Development Methodology
-We have chosen to adopt an Agile methodology for this four-week project. We incorporate Scrum practices such as stand-up meetings 
and utilize Kanban board on Github. Our project will be organized into epics and user stories as discussed in class. 



Communication Plan

During the course of this project, we will communicate using Discord, and Zoom on occasion, 
for project discussion and to coordinate tasks.

 - As for modality, we will be hybrid, either on Zoom or in-person (specific location to be determined).
 - TA Meetings: We will be meeting with our TA every Monday from 5pm to 5:15pm. We will meet over Zoom.
